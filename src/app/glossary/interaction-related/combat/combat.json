  "Combat Structure" : "Combat in Dungeons & Dragons is a dynamic mix of strategy and chaos, structured into rounds and turns to organize the action. Each round represents about six seconds in the game world. During a round, every participant takes a turn, determined by an initiative roll at the encounter's start. The sequence of these turns forms the initiative order, maintained throughout the combat. If the battle is unresolved after one round, the fight progresses to the next, repeating the turn sequence until one side emerges victorious or retreats.",
  "Damage and Healing" : "Damage and healing are core components of combat, representing the physical and magical harm characters can inflict or repair. Damage reduces hit points, while healing restores them, influencing a character's ability to continue fighting. Critical hits, damage types, resistance, vulnerability, and temporary hit points add depth, allowing for varied and strategic combat encounters. Healing mechanisms, including spells and rest, offer recovery options, ensuring characters can survive the rigors of adventure.",
  "Falling Unconscious and Death" : "Combat can lead to characters falling unconscious or dying, adding stakes and consequences to encounters. Characters fall unconscious when their hit points reach zero, triggering death saving throws to determine their fate. Instant death occurs from overwhelming damage, while stabilization offers a reprieve from the brink of death. These mechanics underscore the dangers of combat and the value of strategic play and teamwork.",
  "Initiative" : "Initiative orders the chaos of battle by determining the sequence of combatants' actions. Each participant, including monsters and players, rolls a Dexterity check to set their turn order. This sequence dictates the flow of combat, with the highest rollers acting first. Initiative is crucial for tactical planning, affecting the ability to react to enemies, support allies, and execute strategies effectively.",
  "Mounted Combat" : "Mounted combat introduces new dynamics, offering advantages in speed and mobility. Characters must decide whether to control their mount or let it act independently, affecting movement and actions available during combat. Understanding and leveraging mounted combat can provide tactical benefits, emphasizing the importance of preparation and resource management in achieving victory.",
  "Movement and Position" : "Movement in combat is about more than just relocation; it's a tactical tool. Characters can move up to their speed, navigate difficult terrain, interact with their environment, and even engage in special movements like climbing or swimming. Positioning can influence the battle's outcome, allowing characters to exploit the terrain, flank enemies, or escape danger. Understanding and utilizing movement effectively can turn the tide of battle.",
  "Surprise" : "Surprise plays a pivotal role in combat, allowing an ambush or an unexpected assault. The Dungeon Master (DM) determines which side, if any, is caught off guard based on the characters' stealth and the enemies' perception. Surprised parties can't move, take actions, or react on their first turn, effectively giving their opponents an upper hand. This mechanic underscores the importance of tactics and stealth, enriching the narrative with suspenseful encounters.",
  "Underwater Combat" : "Fighting underwater presents unique challenges and rules, affecting movement, attacks, and the use of weapons and spells. Adaptation is key, with certain weapons and magic proving more effective in aquatic environments. Underwater combat enriches the game with diverse battle scenarios, encouraging players to adapt their strategies to their surroundings."
